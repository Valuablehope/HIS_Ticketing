# HIS Ticketing

This repository contains a sample Supabase schema for a React-based ticketing application. The schema includes triggers that send Telegram bot notifications when:

- A ticket is created (notifying the submitter and all admins)
- A ticket status changes (notifying the submitter)
- A ticket is assigned (notifying the assignee)
- Submitters can include a screenshot URL with each ticket
- Support agents can leave closing feedback when resolving tickets

The SQL schema can be found in [`supabase/schema.sql`](supabase/schema.sql).

## Applying the schema

1. Create a project in [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
2. Open the SQL editor and run the contents of `supabase/schema.sql`.
3. Set the `my.telegram_bot_token` configuration value with your bot token:

```sql
alter role authenticated set my.telegram_bot_token = '<TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN>';
```

4. Ensure each user record in `profiles` has a `telegram_chat_id` so notifications can be delivered.

Tickets include an optional `screenshot_url` column. Files can be uploaded to Supabase Storage and the public URL saved in this column. When closing a ticket, support agents can insert feedback into `ticket_closure_feedback` to store their resolution notes.

The frontâ€‘end can be implemented in React and hosted as static files (e.g., on GitHub Pages) while interacting with Supabase for authentication, data storage, and these server-side notifications.
